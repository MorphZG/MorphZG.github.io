### about me

Since very early age i was interested in programming but life is upredictable,
we often step on a very different path. Charmed by shiny lights, fine music
and fine drinks i decided that bartending is a career for me. Wrong!
True passion was growing inside me, from small little spark my inside was
boiling until it bursts in flames. Point of no return.

### skills

To make it clear. I am far from being expert with these technologies. I am very passionate about it.
Offten short on time, having a full time job as a bartender, those moments in front of the screen with
all tools loaded makes me really excited. Python is my first love and programming language where i am
most comfortable. I enjoy doing coding challanges, practicing and learning every single day.
I hope to find a job this year and finaly prove that it's never late to pursue your dreams.

Alongside python, i am practicing git and backup some of my work with github. I am big fan of command line,
always trying to look behind the surface and learn how things work in the background. That is the main reason
my dev environment is running on linux. Learning about bash scripting along the way. Next step will be learning
more about python web frameworks like django or flask, learn more about databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Started coding with PyCharm but it is more suitable for larger projects. I like to dig deeper and learn
about background process, how things work below surface, understand the process that PyCharm does automaticaly.
I had to research new concepts like virtual environments, dependancy management, git commands...
I had to find a tool with less features where i do more manual work, a text editor.
Sublime-text and VIM are exactly what i need at this moment. VIM have steep learning curve but once you learn
the concept you can almost fly through the code. I try to stay flexible and not attach myself to single tool.
Depending on the project needs i will switch, change and adapt my environment.
